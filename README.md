# Welcome to Flickr project!

**Android, Kotlin, MVVM, Paging**, Retrofit, Facebook shimmer library, Glide, Swipe Refresh Layout library

In this project, the user can see the newly added photos from the popular photos host service - Flickr. (pic. 1 and 2)
Also, when you click on the photo, a new window will open where you can view the photo in more detail (pic. 3 and 4) or go to Flickr for more information (pic. 5 and 6).

This project uses Paging technology allowing infinite scrolling.
You may be familiar with this technology from Instagram or Facebook

Also used Facebook shimmer library and Swipe Refresh Layout library to make User Experience better.

In addition, the application monitors the Internet connection and notifies the user about its absence. (as shown in picture 7 and 8)
