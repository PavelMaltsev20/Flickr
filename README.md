# Welcome to Flickr project!

**Android, Kotlin, MVVM, Paging**, Retrofit, Facebook shimmer library, Glide, Swipe Refresh Layout library

In this project, the user can see the newly added photos from the popular photos host service - Flickr. (*pic. 1 and 2*)

Also, when you click on the photo, a new window will open where you can view the photo in more detail (*pic. 3 and 4*) 
or by button pressing go to Flickr site for more information (*pic. 5 and 6*).

This project uses **Paging technology** allowing infinite scrolling.
You may be familiar with this technology from Instagram or Facebook

Also used **Facebook shimmer** library and **Swipe Refresh Layout** library to make User Experience better.

In addition, the application **monitors the Internet connection** and notifies the user about its absence. (*pic. 7 and 8*)
